# Shapr3D Export to STL for free!

## This is a chrome extension that allows the download of high-resolution models out of the web preview. Huge thanks to three.js for being awesome. 


To install:
1. Download these files to your local machine
2. Open chrome://extensions/
3. Toggle on "developer mode"
4. Click "Load unpacked"
5. Select the folder you just downloaded

To use:

<s>With the extension active, visit any Shapr3D preview link. An "Export STL" button should appear in the bottom right corner.</s>
In your account click the share button in the top right. Then publish the link. Once published you can go to the link to view the model(s) and you should see a new button in the bottom right that says "Export to STL".

THANK YOU SO MUCH MMAHLER2!! Love me some Shapr3d but hate me some subscription fees. So this fork really just fixes the main error that was fucking everything up, there was a hardcoded signed URL. This corrects that so you can downloads all the high rez STLs you create.
